# ImageColourization
Contains implementations of Image Colorization and also Image Out-painting(Till I arrange and seperate outpainting)

Note: Colourization May not work right now as I am currently trying to integrate a pre-trained model.

The results and saved_images folders contain some outputs of the programs
